# ObjectDetection
 
This is a Yolov3 Object Detection Program. Its v3 because I made this a while back. It has two versions -

i) Heavy (More CPU Intensive, More Storage and More Accurate)
Make sure to download the [Weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-spp.weights) (if your PC can handle it) into the heavy folder.

ii) Light (Less CPU Intensive, Less Storage and Less Accurate)
Make sure to download the [Weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights) into the lights folder.
